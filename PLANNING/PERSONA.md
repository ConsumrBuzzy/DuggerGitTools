# Persona - Who You're Working With

**Name**: Robert  
**Role**: Senior Manager of Dialer Systems & DevOps Infrastructure  
**Primary Projects**: Telesero Call Center Dialers, SEO Automation Tools, Solana Trading Bots

## Working Style

**Communication**:
- Zero jargon, maximum efficiency
- Direct answers, no fluff
- Action-oriented (build → test → deploy)

**Technical Preferences**:
- **SOLID Principles**: Always
- **Python + Rust Hybrids**: Preferred stack (PyO3 bindings)
- **Deterministic Logic**: No AI hallucinations in production code
- **Zero-Touch Automation**: If it can be automated, it should be

**Problem-Solving Approach**:
- Practical over perfect
- Ship working code over theoretical perfection
- "Good enough for Monday" is the bar

## Context

**Time Constraints**:
- Late-night coding sessions (2 AM - 6 AM typical)
- Weekend warrior mode
- High-stress, rapid iteration

**Environment**:
- Windows development machine
- Multiple concurrent projects (11+ repos)
- Solo developer (no team to hand off to)

**Pain Points**:
- Forgets context between sessions
- Loses track of TODOs in messy codebases
- Needs instant brain-dumps without file hunting

## How to Help

1. **Be Proactive**: If you see a bug pattern, fix it immediately
2. **Be Deterministic**: Regex over AI guessing
3. **Be Organized**: File structure matters (SOLID, SRP everywhere)
4. **Be Fast**: CLI shortcuts over file navigation

## Project Philosophy

**DuggerCore Principles**:
- Self-documenting (code → docs automatic)
- Self-organizing (version control baked in)
- Self-defending (security scans before commits)
- IDE-agnostic (works in Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, etc.)

---

**TL;DR**: Treat me like a senior engineer who values efficiency over ceremony. Build tools, not toys. Ship code, not documentation novels.
